fm_analytics
============

Dashboard widget for Perch that uses OOcharts to display basic info from Google Analytics

Upload the entire directory to /system/addons/apps


Google Analytics Profile ID
===========================

Configure the settings, adding your OOcharts ID and Google Analytics Profile ID in the settings screen within Perch.

The Google Analytics Profile ID is NOT the UA-xxxxxxx-1 number that identifies your profile. It's also a pain to find!

To get the ID:

* Log in to Analytics
* Click on "Admin", top right
* Select the account in which the profile you wish to use is located
* Select the property you wish to use
* Click the profile name you wish to use
* Click the "Profile Settings" tab
* The Profile ID is shown just after the profile name



OOcharts ID
===========================

You can obtain an OOcharts ID by going to https://oocharts.org/ and clicking the "Get OOId" link.

Copy and paste the long ID into the corresponding field in the Perch settings screen.
